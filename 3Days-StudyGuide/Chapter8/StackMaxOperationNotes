Constraints
1- stack fits in memory
2- integers [1,1000]; positive or negative?
3- Implements push, pop
Ideas

1- Use Linked List to store the stack
- Pop: get head pf the list
- Push: puts an element in the head of the list
- Size: keeps the number of elements on the list
-1 for pop
+1 for push
- Max operation: Look for the maximum value using pop and storing elements in an array of the size of the stack, then reconsstructs the stack from the array

*Complexity
Time - 2n + O(1) => O(n)
Space - O(n)

Test Cases

1- []
2- [1]
3 - [3, 4]
4 - [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
5 - [7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
